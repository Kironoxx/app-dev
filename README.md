Is one of my favorite gundam series because of its spectacular writing, sfx, vfx, and compelling characters , IO Fleming and Daryl Lorenz. It shows the darkness and hypocrisy of war with a modern, cel-animation-esque look.
>The series takes place concurrently with Mobile Suit Gundam, during the One Year War but is not canonical to the original anime. In U.C. 0079, the Earth Federation's Moore Brotherhood and the Principality of Zeon's Living Dead Division engage in a fierce battle in the "Thunderbolt Sector", a shoal zone littered with debris from destroyed space colonies, named for its frequent electrical discharges. Since the outbreak of the war, Zeon forces have secured the Thunderbolt Sector as it is a vital supply route to the Zeon-aligned A Baoa Qu asteroid fortress. The story focuses on Federation soldier Io Fleming as he battles Zeon's best sniper, Daryl Lorenz.
